Questions:
How to go camera, select gallery, search photo
Check if able to grab videos from youtube.

General:
recordSoundArea should probably act differently than photo and video. 

Solutions:
Use tree selections for all media. Search, take, phone. 
Show a small context menu next to the area selected.

Make draggable text and snapshot the stack widget - set resource url to the image.
This allows text to be removed, moved, reedited. (Use flutter for website)
